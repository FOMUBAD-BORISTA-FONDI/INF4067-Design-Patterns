### [Structural Design Patterns]
These patterns focus on solving problems related to the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures.

## Pattern Definitions and Brief Explanations

### 1. Composite Pattern
The Composite Pattern allows combining objects into a larger structure, representing a hierarchy of components. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same manner, simplifying client code and making it more generic.

Below are directives and links to my implementation of the above pattern.

#### [1. MyComposite Pattern](FOMUBAD_BORISTA_FONDI_20V2001/Structural/Composite)
Combine objects into a larger structure, facilitating the representation of hierarchies. Enable clients to handle individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

### 2. Bridge Pattern
The Bridge Pattern separates abstraction from implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

#### [2. MyBridge Pattern](FOMUBAD_BORISTA_FONDI_20V2001/Structural/Bridge)
Separate abstraction from implementation to enable independent variation. Useful when avoiding a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

### 3. Adapter Pattern
The Adapter Pattern allows the collaboration of instances from classes with incompatible interfaces. It converts the interface of an existing class into another interface expected by the client, enabling them to work together seamlessly.

Collaborate instances from classes with incompatible interfaces. Convert the interface of an existing class to another interface expected by the client.

### 4. Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It is useful when you want to add functionalities to objects without altering their structure.

#### [4. MyDecorator Pattern](FOMUBAD_BORISTA_FONDI_20V2001/Structural/Decorator)
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Useful for adding functionalities to objects without altering their structure.

## Running the Code

### Using Visual Studio Code

If you have a Java debugger for Visual Studio Code, you can run any class from the list of available classes.

### Compilation and Execution

Alternatively, you can compile and run the main classes for each pattern using the following commands inside the initial or modified folder in the code directory of each pattern.

You would meet a "run|debug", click on run, and the program would run successfully. Remember that this would appear only in the main classes.
